description: Fix a triaged issue from plans/triage/active/ — delegate the fix and tests to the ralph-implement loop, then confirm resolution with the user before updating the tracker and moving the plan to implemented/. Companion to the triage skill, which drafts the plan this one executes.
---

Fix a triaged issue by following its pre-written plan from `plans/triage/active/`. This skill
knows nothing about any *specific* tracker — Step 5 is where the project's actual
resolve-in-tracker mechanism gets plugged in.

## Step 1 — Locate the plan file

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as an issue number (e.g. `35`) or partial filename.

- Search `plans/triage/active/` (not `implemented/` or `hold/`) for a file matching
  `issue-<number>` or the given string.
- If no match is found, list all open plan files and use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which one to fix.

`triage` always writes plan files with `status: draft` — there's no separate approval UI for this
pipeline the way `feature_analyst` has one; the user invoking this skill on a specific issue *is*
the approval. If the located plan's `status` is still `draft`, flip it to `approved` now, before
delegating in Step 2 (this is what lets `ralph-implement` proceed instead of bouncing it back as
unapproved).

## Step 2 — Delegate the fix and tests

```
Skill(skill: "ralph-implement", args: "plans/triage/active/issue-<N>-*.md")
```

`ralph-implement` reads the plan's `## Root cause` and `## Fix plan` checklist, applies each item,
then works through `## Tests`, running real commands and retrying failures up to the plan's
`max_iterations` before giving up. It owns all checkbox flipping, retry/iteration bookkeeping, and
the final `## Definition of Done` gate. Do not duplicate any of that logic here.

- If it reports `status: blocked` — relay its `## Blocked` section to the user verbatim and stop.
  Do not attempt to silently finish the fix yourself.
- If it reports `status: done` and the plan has a `## UAT verification` section — run the same
  Phase 4.5 black-box loop `feature_analyst` uses (spawn `uat-tester`, retry via
  `ralph-implementer` up to `max_uat_rounds`, blocked on exhaustion) before Step 3.
- If it reports `status: done` (no UAT section, or UAT passed) — proceed to Step 3. The plan file
  is still in `plans/triage/active/` at this point (`ralph-implement` never moves files — that
  stays this skill's job, see Step 5).

## Step 3 — Optional smoke check

If the plan or the issue names a specific command to check, exercise it now via direct invocation
(`.claude/skills/run-hk-bot/SKILL.md`'s "Direct command invocation" pattern) or
`bash .claude/skills/run-hk-bot/smoke.sh`, and verify the specific behavior the issue reported is
now correct. Skip this step entirely if there's no clear way to do it — it's a human-facing sanity
check on top of `## Tests`, not a replacement for it.

## Step 4 — Confirm resolution with user

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:
- Question: `"Issue #<N> — <one-line summary of what was fixed>. Mark as resolved?"`
- Options: `"Yes — mark resolved"`, `"No — something looks wrong"`

If the user selects **No**, ask a follow-up `AskUserQuestion`: "What still looks wrong?" and
investigate.

## Step 5 — Update the tracker and move the plan

Only if the user selected **Yes**:

1. Mark the issue resolved through whatever mechanism this project's tracker uses (a GitHub Issues
   API call, a status field edit) — the specific command is project-specific and not something to
   guess at; use what the plan or this project's docs already show, or ask the user if neither
   says. If the tracker's own resolution flow sends notifications, let it do that — don't invent a
   separate notification step here.
2. Move the plan file: `plans/triage/active/issue-<N>-*.md` →
   `plans/triage/implemented/IMPLEMENTED-issue-<N>-*.md`.
3. Report: "Issue #<N> marked resolved. Plan moved to `implemented/`."

## Notes

- This skill is the pipeline-specific wrapper around `ralph-implement`, not a reimplementation of
  it — it owns issue lookup, the optional smoke check, the human resolution gate, and the
  tracker/`implemented/` bookkeeping, exactly the parts of this flow that are unique to
  triage-sourced bugfixes. `ralph-implement` itself never touches a tracker, never notifies anyone,
  and never moves plan files.
- Do not push to git.
- For any destructive write beyond marking the single issue resolved, ask the user to confirm
  first.
- Triage plan files live in `plans/triage/active/`. Resolved files go to
  `plans/triage/implemented/` with the `IMPLEMENTED-` prefix. On-hold files live in
  `plans/triage/hold/` (the tracker-driven hold state from `triage`, separate from a plan's own
  `status: blocked` frontmatter field, which means the implementation loop hit its retry budget —
  check both meanings if a plan seems stuck).
